# Tentrr Style Guides

These guides are here to help create consistency in our development. Consistency is key. To quote the great Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

> "Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency..."

So let's smell what The Rock is cookin' and keep our code consistent across the board.
